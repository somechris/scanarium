Our aim is not to restrict your use of Scanarium, but to let as many children
see their filled in coloring pages come to life while keeping things open. The
current licensing is not a perfect fit for that. But neither are any of the
other commonly used Open Source Software licenses. So if you have special
licensing requirements, simply reach out by email to licensing@scanarium.com
Chances are, we can find a way to make your use legally sound.
