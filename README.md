# Scanarium

[Documentation Index](docs/index.md)

Scanarium takes your filled in coloring pages and lets them come to life, by
animating them in a given set of scenes. Scanarium should be resource-friendly
to run on old hardware, and can be viewed on any modern browser or mobile phone.

## Live Demo

At [https://demo.scanarium.com/](https://demo.scanarium.com/) Scanarium is running
live. Uploading files has been disabled to avoid creepy content. But the site is
good enough to show what you can expect.



## Installation / Quick-start guide

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
