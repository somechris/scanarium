## Camera rig

If you don't have a proper place to fix your camera to, maybe you have some
Duplos or other interlocking bricks lying around from playing with your kids?
These are very handy when building make-shift camera rigs for Scanarium.



## Lessons learnt

* If Scanarium is running, and you have you browser it full-screen, it can be
tedious to switch to a terminal and re-adjusting the camera. If you can trust
the environment, it's easier if you set `cgi:show-source.allow` to `True` in
`conf/scanarium.conf`. Then, you simply press `s` in the full-screen browser
window, and the camera picture will pop up. Once done with re-adjusting the
camera, simply press enter in the camera window, and in disappears again.

* If you scan from the floor, kids will sometimes accidentaly step on the
background and/or move it around. Tape the background to the floor on off-camera
spots. This helps to keep it in place.

* Mark the background spot where the color pages should go. Either by keeping a
blank page there, or, even better, by marking the spot on the background with
some white tape, so kids cannot accidentally move it.
